# TODO list of things to improve in the GitLab project

 * Move all items on this TODO list to the issue tracker, once we have a
   strategy on how to organize and handle issues.

## Repository

 * Import code by Roxanne (no modification history available)
 * Move scope statement to a sub(sub-)directory in the documentation folder
 * Create folders for documentation of the work progress:
    * Meeting minutes
    
## Project management in Gitlab

 * Understand how to configure and use mailing lists, issue trackers etc.
 
## General

 * Assign roles to developers
 * Establish rules for pushing modifications (maintainer? pull requests?)
 * Establish development model / branching model
