# TODO list of things to improve in the GitLab project

 * Move all items on this TODO list to the issue tracker, once we have a
   strategy on how to organize and handle issues.

> ->  A meeting with Marjolaine is expected the week before christmans to discuss the best way for manage our project (including handle issue, strategy, gitLab uses, ...). We can plan the move just after.

## Repository

 * Import code by Roxanne (no modification history available)

> David is currently working on the Roxane data, with the aims to firstly pick up what is only corresponding to the usable scripts for MAI2 (actually we have crude directory where MIA2 project and other data are mixed !). Then, David will take in hand the scripts that can be use for the MIA2 project. At this time I propose to push these scripts in GItLab.  

 * Move scope statement to a sub(sub-)directory in the documentation folder
 * Create folders for documentation of the work progress:
    * Meeting minutes
    
## Project management in Gitlab

 * Understand how to configure and use mailing lists, issue trackers etc.
 
## General

 * Assign roles to developers
 * Establish rules for pushing modifications (maintainer? pull requests?)
 * Establish development model / branching model
