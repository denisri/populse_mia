# TODO list of things to improve in the GitLab project

 * Move all items on this TODO list to the issue tracker, once we have a
   strategy on how to organize and handle issues.

> ->  A meeting with Marjolaine is expected the week before christmans to discuss the best way for manage our project (including handle issue, strategy, gitLab uses, ...). We can plan the move just after.

## Repository

 * Import code by Roxanne (no modification history available)

> -> David is currently working on the Roxane data, with the aims to firstly pick up what is only corresponding to the usable scripts for MAI2 (actually we have crude directory where MIA2 project and other data are mixed !). Then, David will take in hand the scripts that can be used for the MIA2 project. At this time I propose to push these scripts in GItLab.  

 * Move scope statement to a sub(sub-)directory in the documentation folder

> -> Done!

 * Create folders for documentation of the work progress:
    * Meeting minutes

> -> Done!
    
## Project management in Gitlab

 * Understand how to configure and use mailing lists, issue trackers etc.

> -> This is the goal of the talk of David in the next group meeting, 9:30 September 12th 2017. A second chance will exist, the week before christmas, with Marjolaine :-)!
 
## General

 * Assign roles to developers
 * Establish rules for pushing modifications (maintainer? pull requests?)
 * Establish development model / branching model

> -> Can be defined just after the talk on GitLab of David and the meeting with Marjolaine. I propose also to establish rules for maintain this todo list!

## Miscellaneous

 * Questions to settle:

    - Brick (or pipeline component): smallest data processing unit (ex. register) - Module: a brick or a pipeline - Pipeline: is constituted of one or more modules -> in this case what is the name of each box in the synoptic representation of MIA2 ?
    - Brick (or pipeline component): smallest data processing unit (ex. register) - Pipeline: is constituted of one or more bricks or pipelines -> in this case we can use "module" for each box in the synoptic representation of MIA2 ?
